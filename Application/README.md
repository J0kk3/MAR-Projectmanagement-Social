# Application
The application layer is responsible for coordinating tasks and managing the flow of control between the domain layer and the other layers. It contains services, which orchestrate operations and use cases that involve multiple domain entities. The application layer is also responsible for defining interfaces (contracts) for external dependencies, such as repositories or APIs.

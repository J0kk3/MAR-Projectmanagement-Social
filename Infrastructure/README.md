# Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure layer is a key component of a system's architecture that provides a bridge between your domain or application layers and any external concerns. This layer is typically where you'll implement concerns such as persistence, networking, and security.

The infrastructure layer is primarily responsible for handling the technical concerns or the "plumbing" of a system. Here, you can find:

    Data Access: The Infrastructure layer often includes the code for accessing databases, including the creation of data repositories and implementation of data access methods.

    Networking: Code to make HTTP requests, connect to different APIs, or interact with other microservices often resides in the infrastructure layer.

    Security: It handles aspects related to user authentication and authorization, like user management, password hashing, JWT management, etc.

    File I/O: Any code that directly interacts with the file system would also reside in the infrastructure layer.

    Other External Concerns: Any interaction with third-party services, libraries, or APIs would be encapsulated in the infrastructure layer. This can include things like sending email notifications or handling payment transactions.

The primary role of the Infrastructure layer is to isolate the ways in which the application communicates with these external concerns. By doing so, you're able to swap out specific implementations without needing to change your application or domain layers.

For example, you might start by saving data to a SQLite database but later decide to use MongoDB. By encapsulating the data access code in the infrastructure layer, you can make this change relatively easily without affecting the rest of your application.

Remember that this layer should depend on the application and domain layers, and not the other way around, to maintain a separation of concerns and ensure your business logic is not directly dependent on external systems.

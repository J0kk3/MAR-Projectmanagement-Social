Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. Make sure theres only one feature per commit.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

~~~
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

~~~

# Domain
Contains the core business logic, which includes domain models, entities, and business rules. This layer should be independent of any external dependencies or frameworks.
The domain objects, also known as entities or models, go here. These are the core business objects that the application is built around. Also, interfaces for repositories and services that are used in the domain layer are also defined here.
